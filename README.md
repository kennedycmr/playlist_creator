# README.md

This tiny script is used to generate a simple m3u playlist of local music tracks.

## Use-Case

I have a large collection of music tracks that I copy to my phone where I use vlc media player to play when I am on the go. The two issues I solved by using a playlist, is I find vlc does a poor job of "randomizing" the audio songs. I end up with "hot" songs that I listen to a lot, and some tracks I rarely listen to. Also, I often have podcasts or audiobooks on my phone and I don't want them included when I am just trying to listen to music. By creating a playlist of all my music tracks in random order, I have an easy selection to play on the phone that I know is consistent and will work the way I want.

## How to Use

* Script will run with basic Python3. Tested on Fedora Linux with python3 v3.12.
* Launch the script in any directory. You will be prompted for where your music files reside, where you want the output playlist to be created and whether you want the output randomized.
